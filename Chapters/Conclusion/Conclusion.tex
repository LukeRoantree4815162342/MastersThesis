\section{Review of Project Goals}
%This `baseline solution' finds the first $k$ eigenstates of the Hamiltonian associated with an elecron interacting with a Hydrogenic atom at an instant, with the Coulomb Potential being modelled instead by a Soft-Core potential - which at all but very small distances is an accurate approximation of the Coulomb Potential. Due to the Coulomb Potential tending towards $\infty$ as $r\rightarrow 0$ it is difficult to model it numerically, but with a Soft-Core Potential approximation, we avoid the issues at small $r$s yet obtain accurate results for everywhere other than at the center.

%Is this an appropriate place for the above?

%The Radial TISE is a simplification of the TISE for the case where the system is spherically symmetric, which is the case for a Hydrogenic atom - for both a Coulomb Potential or a Soft-Core Potential.
In this thesis, the interactions of laser pulses with quantum systems are investigated. The systems investigated are limited to Hydrogenic atoms; that is spherically-symmetric systems with a central attractive potential field; the Coulomb potential. Such systems allow several simplifications to calculations based on symmetry, while still remaining useful models of many real molecules, atoms, or sub-atomic particles. Before describing the mathematical models used in the investigation, some relevant quantum theory, numerical analysis, and computational methods are revisited.
