\section{RMT}
RMT is open-sourced and freely available at 

\texttt{https://gitlab.com/Uk-amor/RMT}.


My development was on the `fd\_propagation' branch.

\section{My `Toy Code'}
The codes I developed throughout the project, prior to my RMT work, are available on GitHub, at 

\texttt{https://github.com/LukeRoantree4815162342/MastersProject}.


They primarily consist of Python3.6 Jupyter notebooks, and Python3.6 script files.
